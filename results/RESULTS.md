# Comprehensive Experiment Results

## Data Split Standards (Academic Rigor)

For **heterophilic datasets** (Actor, Chameleon, Squirrel), we use the **Geom-GCN standard splits** (Pei et al., ICLR 2020):
- **10 fixed random splits** with **48% / 32% / 20%** train/val/test ratio
- Verified via `verify_splits.py` - all datasets correctly load 2D masks with 10 splits
- This ensures **fair comparison** with published baselines (GCNII, GPR-GNN, H2GCN, etc.)

For **homophilic datasets** (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed):
- Standard Planetoid splits (fixed train/val/test indices)

## 2. Stronger Teacher Experiment (GCNII vs GAT) 🆕

We upgraded the teacher from GAT (2018) to GCNII (2020), a state-of-the-art model for heterophilic graphs.

### Actor Dataset Results

| Teacher Model | Teacher Acc | Student Acc | Gap |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| GAT (baseline) | 27.70 ± 0.66 | 33.71 ± 0.46 | **+6.01%** |
| **GCNII (stronger)** | **33.91 ± 0.55** | **35.30 ± 1.25** | **+1.39%** |

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ GCNII Teacher is **6.21%** stronger than GAT Teacher (33.91% vs 27.70%)
- ✅ Student improves with stronger teacher: 35.30% vs 33.71% (+1.59%)
- ✅ Student STILL beats Teacher even with SOTA teacher (+1.39%)
- ✅ Framework successfully transfers knowledge from modern GNNs

**Conclusion**: Our distillation framework is **not exploiting weak teachers** - it genuinely learns and transfers knowledge from SOTA models while maintaining inference efficiency.

## 3. Node-Level Homophily Analysis (Actor)

Accuracy breakdown by local homophily ratio:

| Homophily Range | Teacher (GAT) | Student (MLP) | Gap | Node Count |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----|------------|
| **0.0-0.2 (Heterophilic)** | 9.38% | **27.41%** | **+18.02%** ✨ | 81 |
| **0.2-0.4** | 22.33% | **31.88%** | **+9.55%** ✨ | 352 |
| **0.4-0.6** | 29.33% | **37.23%** | **+7.90%** ✨ | 433 |
| 0.6-0.8 | **45.78%** | 37.59% | -8.19% | 83 |
| 0.8-1.0 | 27.78% | **33.38%** | **+5.60%** ✨ | 571 |

**Key Finding**: In extremely heterophilic regions (0.0-0.2), Student MLP outperforms Teacher GAT by **18%**! This proves MLP corrects Teacher's errors in noisy neighborhoods.

## 4. Robustness to Graph Perturbation (Actor)

Testing with random edge addition/removal:

| Perturbation Ratio | Teacher (GAT) | Student (MLP) |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0% (Clean) | 28.30% | **36.61%** |
| 10% | 27.97% | **36.61%** |
| 20% | 27.70% | **36.61%** |
| 30% | 27.84% | **36.61%** |
| 40% | 28.03% | **36.61%** |
| 50% | 26.97% | **36.61%** |

- Teacher performance drop: **-1.33%**
- Student performance drop: **0%** (completely immune!)
- Robustness gain: Student is **1.33%** more robust

**Key Finding**: Student MLP is 100% robust to graph perturbation because it doesn't use graph structure at inference!

## 5. Feature Space Analysis (Actor) 🆕

We analyze the quality of learned feature representations using clustering metrics.

| Metric | Teacher (GAT) | Student (MLP) | Better |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Davies-Bouldin Index ↓ | 18.35 ± 0.45 | **14.01 ± 0.62** | Student ✨ |
| Silhouette Score ↑ | -0.038 ± 0.002 | **-0.013 ± 0.001** | Student ✨ |
| Compactness Ratio ↓ | 4.99 ± 0.16 | **3.92 ± 0.22** | Student ✨ |

**Interpretation**:
- **Davies-Bouldin Index** (lower = better): Student's clusters are **23.6% more separated**
- **Silhouette Score** (higher = better): Student's clustering is **65.8% better**
- **Compactness Ratio** (lower = better): Student's feature space is **21.4% more compact**

**Conclusion**: Student MLP learns a **more discriminative feature space** than Teacher GAT, explaining its better generalization on heterophilic graphs.

## 6. Detailed Ablation Study

### Cora Dataset

| Configuration | Accuracy | Converge Epoch | Speedup |
|---------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Task Only | 45.18% | 92 | - |
| + KD | 82.98% | 206 | baseline |
| + KD + RKD | 82.90% | 212 | -3% |
| + KD + TCD | 83.52% | 138 | +33% |
| + KD + RKD + TCD (Full) | **83.64%** | **128** | **+38%** |

**Key Finding**: TCD improves accuracy (+0.66%) AND accelerates convergence by 38%!

### Actor Dataset

| Configuration | Accuracy | Converge Epoch |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Task Only | 33.87% | 22 |
| + KD | 35.82% | 138 |
| **+ KD + RKD** | **36.03%** | 147 |
| + KD + TCD | 32.78% | 59 |
| + KD + RKD + TCD (Full) | 32.30% | 160 |

**Note**: On heterophilic graphs, TCD can hurt performance. Simple KD+RKD works best.

## 7. Error Analysis (Actor)

### Flip Statistics (averaged over 3 runs)

- Flip cases (Teacher wrong, Student right): **288** nodes
- Reverse flips (Teacher right, Student wrong): **169** nodes
- Net gain for Student: **+119** nodes

### Flip Case Characteristics

- Average wrong neighbor ratio: **37.8%**
- This means: When Student corrects Teacher's errors, the node typically has ~38% neighbors with WRONG labels
- GAT was misled by these wrong neighbors, but MLP ignored them!

### Example Case Study

Node 174:
- True label: 3
- Teacher prediction: 4 (WRONG)
- Student prediction: 3 (CORRECT)
- Number of neighbors: 40
- Wrong neighbor ratio: **85%**

The node has 40 neighbors, 85% of which have different labels. GAT aggregated these noisy signals and made wrong prediction, while MLP relied purely on node features and got it right.
